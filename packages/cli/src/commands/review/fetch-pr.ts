// `qwen review fetch-pr`: prepare a PR review's working state in a single
// deterministic pass.
//
//   1. Clean any stale worktree / branch from a previously interrupted run
//      so the new run starts fresh.
//   2. `git fetch <remote> pull/<n>/head:qwen-review/pr-<n>` — pull the PR
//      HEAD into a unique local ref (does not modify the user's working
//      tree, unlike `gh pr checkout`).
//   3. `gh pr view ...` to fetch metadata (head/base ref names, head SHA,
//      diff stats, cross-repo flag).
//   4. `git worktree add` to create an ephemeral worktree at
//      `.qwen/tmp/review-pr-<n>` so subsequent steps can run in isolation.
//   5. Capture the review diff to `.qwen/tmp/qwen-review-pr-<n>-diff.txt` and
//      partition it into chunks. Review agents `read_file` a chunk's line
//      range instead of running `git diff` themselves: Shell keeps a 30 000
//      character persistence trigger but returns an approximately 4 000
//      character head-and-tail model preview, which hides most of a large diff
//      from every agent at once. See `lib/diff-plan.ts`.
//   6. Emit a single JSON report describing the resulting state, which the
//      LLM reads to drive the rest of Step 1.
