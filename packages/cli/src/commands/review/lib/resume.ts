// May this run continue the interrupted one, or must it start over?
//
// The ruling is pure: `fetch-pr --resume` gathers the probes (git, gh, file
// hashes, the resume marker) and this function only compares them. Every
// check fails toward a FRESH run — resuming on stale state would continue a
// review of code nobody is reviewing anymore, which is strictly worse than
// re-fetching. The checkpoint key is content (the diff's sha256, the head
// SHA), never a path or a timestamp: input that changed re-runs, by
// construction rather than by invalidation logic.
//
// Every field of the previous report the resumed pipeline would consume is
// verified here against a fact this run derived itself. The report sits on a
// disk the reviewed PR's own code could write during attempt 1, so a field
// this ruling does not compare is a field the attacker chooses: the resumed
// agents would route through it while the verdict cites the genuine head.
