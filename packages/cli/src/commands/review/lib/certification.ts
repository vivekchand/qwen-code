/**
 * The atoms of the certification bar, defined once.
 *
 * Every consumer that decides whether a transcript's agent did the work it
 * was launched for — the coverage walk, its supersession predicates, the
 * recovered-work counter, the layer-audit gate, retirement's pairing, and
 * `recover-findings`' recovery bar — asks some conjunction of the same five
 * questions: did it return, did it disown its own territory, did it open its
 * brief, did it read the findings list its prompt names, which chunk was it
 * assigned. Five review rounds found five places where a re-implemented copy
 * of one of these atoms drifted from the original; this module exists so
 * there is nothing left to drift. Compositions still differ per consumer —
 * that is their job — and the `returned` question stays a plain field read
 * (`rec.returned`) at each site rather than an atom here; every OTHER atom
 * has exactly one definition below.
